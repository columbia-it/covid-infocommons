CIC harvesting tools
======================

This directory contains some utility code for working with the CIC
API. There is one file for working with each type of CIC data (e.g.,
`cic_grants.py`). There other files build on this code to harvest
content from external sources, or to improve the quality of content
that has already been harvested.
